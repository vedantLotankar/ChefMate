# 🚨 FINAL FIX - Network Error Issue

## **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**

The error shows: `API Error: undefined /api/chat/cooking-details`

This means `API_BASE_URL` is **undefined** when the API client is created.

## ✅ **BACKEND IS RUNNING:**
- Port 3000 is active (PID: 21260)
- Backend server is accessible

## 🔧 **THE PROBLEM:**

The `API_BASE_URL` is showing as `undefined` which means the environment isn't being detected properly.

## 🎯 **SOLUTION - DO THIS NOW:**

### **Step 1: Restart Your Expo App**

The constants file was just updated with debug logging. You need to reload:

```bash
# Press 'r' in the Expo terminal to reload
# OR stop and restart: expo start -c
```

### **Step 2: Check the Console Logs**

After restarting, look for these logs:
```
🔧 Platform.OS: android
🔧 __DEV__: true
🔧 Using Android URL: http://10.0.2.2:3000
🔧 Final API_BASE_URL: http://10.0.2.2:3000
```

### **Step 3: If Still Getting "undefined"**

If you still see `undefined`, add this to your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "extra": {
      "backendUrl": "http://10.0.2.2:3000"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **QUICK TEST:**

1. Restart Expo app (press 'r' in terminal)
2. Open any recipe
3. Click "Cooking Mode"
4. Check console for the 🔧 logs
5. Should now work!

## 📋 **Current Status:**

✅ Backend running on port 3000
✅ Environment variables fixed  
✅ Debug logging added
⏳ Need app restart to apply changes

**NEXT STEP: Restart your Expo app!**
